Make sure to have Python 3.10 installed: https://www.python.org/downloads/

Install virtual environment with "install_text_analysis_api_venv.bat"
Install required packages with "install_text_analysis_api_requirements.bat"
Create a log folder in "Api_TextAnalysis" folder.
Copy models to "Api_TextAnalysis/ai_models".
Set configurations in config files under "Api_TextAnalysis/app/configs"






Run as windows service:

Download NSSM: https://nssm.cc/download
Add the path to nssm.exe to environment path
In cmd run: "call nssm.exe install TextAnalyzerService '%cd%\start_text_analysis_api.bat'"

Edit the service using nssm GUI:
nssm edit TextAnalyzerService

You can now start the service:
Start a service - sc TextAnalyzerService

'sc' command to manage services in command line:
Delete a service - sc delete TextAnalyzerService
Start a service - sc start TextAnalyzerService
Pause a service - sc pause TextAnalyzerService
Stop a service - sc stop TextAnalyzerService

View status of a service in command line:
sc query my_flask_app

You can see and change the service in windows services/tj√§nster.
Default might be to run the service on system start-up automatically.

If you want to implement logging, make sure to create the log directory before.
Example:
call nssm.exe set my_flask_app AppStdout "%cd%\logs\my_flask_app_logs.log"
call nssm.exe set my_flask_app AppStderr "%cd%\logs\my_flask_app_logs.log"
call nssm set my_flask_app AppRotateFiles 1
call nssm set my_flask_app AppRotateOnline 1
call nssm set my_flask_app AppRotateSeconds 86400
call nssm set my_flask_app AppRotateBytes 1048576

- Probably a good idea to have a dedicated folder in logs: logs/service_logs/, since the application is logging in logs.
